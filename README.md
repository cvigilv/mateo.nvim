# mateo.nvim ðŸ§ 

> _mateo_ (chilean slang)
> 1. A person who obtains good grades or marks regularly, studious person.
> 2. A person who without the merit of studying obtains good grades.

This is the `refactor` branch of `mateo.nvim`, which serves 2 purposes: (i) be a guide for
setting Neovim as a Julia Language development and (ii) clean my Neovim setup since I have
decided to fully invest in Julia as my main programming language.

:exclamation: This repo intends to be a **minimalistic** (less than 1000 lines of code over all the
files) and **opinionated** setup, therefore some design choices may be made (either good or bad)
under my own opinions of what's best or what I like more in this setup.

## What will this repo contain?

I need, as a minimum value product, the following for Julia Language development:

- Better Neovim defaults
- Highlighting
- LSP
- Autocompletion & snippets
- REPL integration
- Quality-of-life plugins
